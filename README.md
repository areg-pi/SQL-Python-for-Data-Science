# Databases and SQL for Data Science with Python
This is a small repo that contains the notebooks and data I used in a course from IBM in Coursera.

The purpose of this course is to introduce relational database concepts and help learn and apply foundational knowledge of the SQL language. It is also intended to get started with performing SQL access in a data science environment.  

The main tools used in this course are:
*   Python
*   SQL
*   Frameworks/libraries: Pandas, SQL Alchemy, IBM DBI and others
*   Jupyter notebook

Also, this repo contains public data collected from the Chicago State site about socioeconomic indicators, census and crime history.

Plus, material of the course (PDFs, mp4s, images) was also added.
